# VPN-Toolbar
A script to update your real IP vs VPN in the genmon tool in Kali Linux

1. Add the generic monitor tool to the top panel
2. Right click on the `genmon | xxx` and select 'Properties'
3. In the 'Command' space enter `bash /opt/genmon.sh`
4. In the 'Label' space just delete current text and add one space
5. 'Period' is how often the script will run and update the panel; default '30' seconds is good
6. Edit the fonts to your liking, and save
7. Wait for the script to run and update the panel
